    "## Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section we'll make of the CAOS system, via the provided CAOS CLI, to demonstrate how it can be used on a day-to-day basis by an end-user to manage his financial transactions and negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this demo, was created based on real transaction data from a financial partner. The data has been already converted to a JSON file (`gen_data.json`) that follows the required guidelines of CAOS. In particular, this format is actually a serialized version of the working state of the system that includes all details for every client involved, every relevant contract but also the system configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first we can start the system via the interface and load the state from the input json file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](img\demo_load.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can request a report of the state using the report command to check the input data\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](img\demo_first_report_1.png?raw=true)\n",
    "![Invocation](img\demo_first_report_2.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see in the summary that the current system state includes 43 contracts involving 11 different clients with contracts within a planning horizon of 11 periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can select a contract for further processing. First we enter the `contract` menu and use the `select` command. The user is prompted to enter a desired period range to search for available contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](img/demo_action1_select.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we selected to search contracts for periods 1 and 2 of the planning horizon. The system reports the available contracts and asks the user to select one of the available contracts. For demo purposes we selected the first contract. If the user wants to select a different contract they can execute the `select` command again and make a different selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can request from the system to analyze all the available negotiation options using the `analyze` command of the `state` menu. This step, generates a set of scenarios of the selected contract and evaluates them using the UP framework. The user is notified when the analysis has been completed and how many scenarios were evaluated and how much time was required for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_analyze.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the analysis is complete, the user can use this information to get the best negotiation options to propose to the counterparty for this particular contract. To do that, we can open to the `action` menu and choose the `select` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_select.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are asked to choose between the 3 available policies for the action selection. For the purposes of this demo we'll choose the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_select1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will now propose negotiation actions that promise to maximize the objective related to the policy that we selected. In this case, since we selected the weighted policy, the actions with the largest weighted objective will be proposed first. \n",
    "\n",
    "For every suggestion the system provides valuable information such as the total number of scenarios that evaluated these negotiation options and several aggregate statistics regarding the corresponding scenario probabilities (see the Scenario Generation Module documentation for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this interactive menu, the user can select an action, make the necessary (offline) negotiations with the counterparty for this particular contract, and then inform the system whether or not the negotiations were successful or not. In the case that the user response negatively, the system provides the next best available option.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_select2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time during this phase, the user can input `Q` to exit this negotiation mode. By using the `select` command again, the user can restart the negotiation mode using a different policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_select3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here for example, we chose the optimistic policy, and we notice that the evaluation of this new negotiation option, provided on average a greater total probability of happening (48.27%) compared to the first suggested option (44.49%). In addition, the system also provides the probability that the counterparty will accept the new contract options. This means that negotiation proposal may be turned down, no matter how high the total probability of the evaluated scenarios is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that this negotiation option was proposed to the user and they declined. After all, the chance of their acceptance was estimated at 30.35%. After entering the negotiation results to the system, it provides the next most optimistic scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_select4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we notice that this option has a much higher acceptance probability (76.91%) compared to the previous one. Let us assume that the counterparty accepted this proposition. The user can now input `Y` to confirm that the negotiation has been finalized. If the user is willing to apply this action to the system, this can be done using the `apply` command of the `action` menu. Note that, if the negotiation process is cancelled, or no option is selected, then a default action is selected by default that does not change any information of the selected contract. The user has to still use the `apply` command to verify that the contract will remain intact and they do not intend to restart negotiations for this contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_apply1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once more, the details of the selected negotiation option are shown and they user is asked to confirm the action for the final time. If the user responds negatively, they are free to restart the negotiation process all over. If they respond positively, the proposed action is applied to the current state. This can be verified by using the `report` command on the `state` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_action1_applied_report.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can see that contract 1's status has been updated to `NEGOTIATED` and that the payment was deferred to period 2 with an increased payment amount by 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can now continue selecting, analyzing and negotiating contracts as described. However, no matter how many contracts are negotiated, the system needs to advance to the next period in order to finalize contracts of the current period and update the current balance of the user. For this step to be completed, the user must finalize negotiations with the contracts of the current period and then use the `advance` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_period_advance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we processed all the contracts of the current period (Period 0), and used the `advance` command. Notice the new report of the state that has now a positive balance due to the processing of inbound payments of the previous period.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the system is running and progressing from period to period, the user may need to add new contracts or clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we showcase how to a new client named `Demo` along with all the parameters that control his behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_client_add.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can proceed to add new contracts with thew new client using the `add` command of the `contract` menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_contract_add.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we added a new inbound contract with a total amount of 4000.0 that has to be completed on Period 1. Using the `report` command we can see the new contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_new_contract_report.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time, the user can save the current state to a JSON file using the `save` command. The user may exit the application using the `exit` command. Again, the user will be prompted to save the current state to a json file to prevent the loss of unsaved changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Invocation](./img/demo_exit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we saved the current state to a new file called `demo_state.json`. After restarting the application we can load the created state function as shown before and we can continue working on the state like previously.\n",
